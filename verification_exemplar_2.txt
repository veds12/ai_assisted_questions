(user) You are a professional math teacher. You want to evaluate the analytical and mathematical reasoning abilities of your students. The evaluation is designed to test the students' expertise in using two given mathematical skills simultaneously. This is achieved by asking them to solve a question that necessitates expertise in both skills to be solved completely. Since evaluating the students is a critical task allowing very little margin for any error in the process, it is very important to ensure that the questions used for evaluating are high quality and fit for being used to evaluate the students. You need to carefully review the question and a given attempt at solving it, and ensure that the question is of high quality and fit to assess students. In order to do this, you should check the quality of the question with respect to several criteria, such as:

- Single Answer Requirement: The question should ask for one and only one final result. It should not request multiple distinct answers or pieces of information.
- Exact Answer Requirement: It should be possible to achieve one,exact answer to the question, without the need of making any approximations or assumptions whatsoever, unless explicitly specified in the question. There should be no margin for the students to arrive at any other possible answer due to things like rounding errors, etc.
- Dual Skill Requirement: The question must require rigorous expertise in both specified skills for resolution. Application of each skill and its subskills should be, necessary and contribute directly to obtaining the final answer; each skill should be applicable separately and critically during the problem-solving process. You are also given three example question - answer pairs for each skill in order to help you better understand the meaning of each skill. Please carefully review the question and its attempted solution, paying close attention to how well it aligns with the examples provided for each skill. Consider the depth and breadth of knowledge demonstrated in the examples. The complexity / difficulty of each skill application in the question should be similar or greater than the complexity / difficulty of the skill in the example question-answers given for that respective skill. 
- Clarity and Completeness: The question should be unambiguous and contain all the information necessary to complete the solution. Any required assumptions not common knowledge should be explicitly stated. Check for any ambiguity that might confuse students.
- Relevancy of Information: The question should not have any extra details that do not contribute to the solving of the problem.
- Realism and Logic: The question should involve realistic scenarios or hypotheses with logically consistent data. The specified operations and the contextual setup should reflect plausible mathematical situations. (e.g., positive amounts for transactions, integers for counts).
- Syntax and Grammar: The question must be grammatically correct and clearly written to prevent misinterpretation.
- etc. (any other problems which you think make the question not fit for being used for evaluating the students)

Your task is to give a 'Yes' or 'No' assessment, indicating whether the question is high quality and suitable for student evaluation. Provide thorough reasoning for your assessment based on the conditions mentioned above and any other relevant analytical points concerning mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. Your response should be structured as follows:

# REASONING
<Your detailed analysis justifying your decision>

# FINAL ANSWER
<'Yes' or 'No'. No other text should be present in this section>

Ensure to review the combination of skills intended for assessment, and check the logical flow and mathematical correctness from the question's setup to the solution's conclusion. Account for all the potential pitfalls such as logical inconsistencies, unnecessary complexity, or insufficient detail that may obstruct the clarity or solvability of the question.

Given below are the two skills and some example question-answer pairs for the two skills. This skill description is followed by the question which you need to check (preceded by '# QUESTION TO BE CHECKED') and its attempted solution (preceded by '# SOLUTION ATTEMPT'). 

SKILL 1: area_calculation_skills

Question 1: How many values of $x$ with $0^\circ \le x < 360^\circ$ satisfy $\sin x = -0.73$? 
Answer 1: [asy]
pair A,C,P,O,D;
draw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));
draw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));
A = (1,0);
O= (0,0);
label("$x$",(1.2,0),SE);
label("$y$",(0,1.2),NE);

P = rotate(150)*A;
D = foot(P,A,-A);
draw(Circle(O,1));
label("$O$",O,SE);

draw((-1,-0.73)--(1,-0.73),red);
[/asy]

For each point on the unit circle with $y$-coordinate equal to $-0.73$, there is a corresponding angle whose sine is $-0.73$.  There are two such points; these are the intersections of the unit circle and the line $y=-0.73$, shown in red above.  Therefore, there are $\boxed{2}$ values of $x$ with $0^\circ \le x < 360^\circ$ such that $\sin x = -0.73$.

Question 2: Triangle $ABC$ has vertices $A(0, 8)$, $B(2, 0)$, $C(8, 0)$.  A horizontal line with equation $y=t$ intersects line segment $ \overline{AB} $ at $T$ and line segment $ \overline{AC} $ at $U$, forming $\triangle ATU$ with area 13.5.  Compute $t$.
Answer 2: The line through $A$ and $B$ has slope $\frac{0-8}{2-0}=-4$ and passes through $(0,8)$, so thus has equation $y=-4x+8$. The line through $A$ and $C$ has slope $\frac{0-8}{8-0}=-1$ and passes through $(0,8)$, so thus has equation $y=-x+8$.

The point $T$ is the point on the line $y=-4x+8$ with $y$-coordinate $t$.  To find the $x$-coordinate, we solve $t=-4x+8$ to get $4x = 8-t$ or $x = \frac{1}{4}(8-t)$.  The point $U$ is the point on the line $y=-x+8$ with $y$-coordinate $t$.  To find the $x$-coordinate, we solve $t=-x+8$ to get $x = 8-t$.

Therefore, $T$ has coordinates $(\frac{1}{4}(8-t),t)$, $U$ has coordinates $(8-t,t)$, and $A$ is at $(0,8)$.

$TU$ is horizontal and has length $(8-t)-\frac{1}{4}(8-t)=\frac{3}{4}(8-t)$ and the distance from $TU$ to $A$ is $8-t$, so the area in terms of $t$ is \[\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{4}(8-t)\right)(8-t) = \frac{3}{8}(8-t)^2.\]Since this equals $13.5$, we have $\frac{3}{8}(8-t)^2 = 13.5$ or $(8-t)^2 = \frac{8}{3}(13.5)=36$.  Because line segment $TU$ is below $A$, $t<8$, and so $8-t>0$.  Therefore, $8-t=6 \Rightarrow t=8-6=\boxed{2}$.

Question 3: In the figure, $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $AZ=WC=6$ units, $AB=12$ units and the area of trapezoid $ZWCD$ is 120 square units. What is the area of triangle $BQW$? [asy]
draw((0,0)--(12,0)--(12,20)--(0,20)--(0,0)--(12,20));
draw((0,14)--(12,6));
label("$A$",(0,20),W);
label("$Z$",(0,14),W);
label("$D$",(0,0),W);
label("$Q$",(6,10),2S);
label("$B$",(12,20),E);
label("$W$",(12,6),E);
label("$C$",(12,0),E);
[/asy]
Answer 3: Because the figure has rotational symmetry, $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$. Consequently, the triangles $BZQ$ and $BWQ$ have the same area because they share a height and have bases that are the same length. We have

$$[BQW]=\dfrac{1}{2}[BZW]=\dfrac{1}{2}\left([ABWZ]-[ABZ]\right)$$$$=\dfrac{1}{2}\left(120-\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot6\cdot12\right)=\dfrac{1}{2}(120-36)=\dfrac{84}{2}=\boxed{42}.$$

SKILL 2: arithmetic_sequences

Question 1: What is the arithmetic mean of all positive two-digit multiples of 7? 
Answer 1: We use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find that the arithmetic mean of the positive two-digit multiples of 7 is $\frac{14+21+...+98}{13}=\frac{1}{13}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot13\cdot(14+98)=\boxed{56}$.

Question 2: Find the remainder when $109876543210$ is divided by $180$. 
Answer 2: Let $N = 109876543210$. Notice that $180 = 4 \times 9 \times 5$, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to evaluate the remainders when $N$ is divided by each of $4$, $9$, and $5$. We can apply the divisibility rules to find each of these. Since the last two digits of $N$ are $10$, it follows that $N \equiv 10 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$. We know that $N$ is divisible by $5$, so $N \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$. Finally, since $N$ leaves the same residue modulo $9$ as the sum of its digits, then $$N \equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 9 + 1 \equiv 1+ \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} \equiv 46 \equiv 1 \pmod{9}.$$By the Chinese Remainder Theorem and inspection, it follows that $N \equiv 10 \pmod{4 \cdot 9}$, and since $10$ is also divisible by $5$, then $N \equiv \boxed{10} \pmod{180}$.

Question 3: What is the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18?
Answer 3: We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\boxed{990}$.

# QUESTION TO BE CHECKED
There's a rectangle with an area of 360 square units. The length of the rectangle is part of an arithmetic sequence starting at 5 and with a common difference of 7. If the other side of the rectangle is also part of an arithmetic sequence with the first term 10 and common difference 3, find the length of the shortest side of the rectangle.

# SOLUTION ATTEMPT
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the values of the lengths of the rectangle that fit within the respective arithmetic sequences and still satisfy the condition that the area of the rectangle is 360 square units.

### Step 1: Express the arithmetic sequences
1. Length (l) of the rectangle, part of an arithmetic sequence starting at 5 with a common difference of 7. So, l can be represented as:
        \[
        l = 5 + 7k \quad        ext{where}\ k   ext{ is a non-negative integer.}
        \]

2. The other side (w), part of an arithmetic sequence starting at 10 with a common difference of 3. So, w can be represented as:
        \[
        w = 10 + 3j \quad       ext{where}\ j   ext{ is a non-negative integer.}
        \]

### Step 2: Relationship between length and width for a given area
Given the area of the rectangle (A) is 360 square units, we have:
\[
l \cdot w = 360
\]
Replacing l and w from the above expressions, we get:
\[
(5 + 7k) \cdot (10 + 3j) = 360
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
50 + 15j + 70k + 21kj = 360
\]
\[
21kj + 70k + 15j + 50 = 360
\]
\[
21kj + 70k + 15j = 310
\]

### Step 3: Solve for integer values of k and j
We need k and j to be non-negative integers. Let’s simplify further to test integer values:
\[
21kj + 70k + 15j \doteq 310 
\]
Due to the complexity of the equation, we start by choosing simple integer values for either k or j and calculate the other:

Let's fix k = 0, 1, 2, etc., and solve for j.

- **For k = 0**:
\[
w = 10 + 3j
\]
As \( l = 5 \):
\[
ightarrow j = = 310  360 
              rac{310}{15} pprox 20.67
\]
Not an integer, so no solution here.

- **For k = 1**:
\[
l = 5 + 7 \cdot 1 = 12
\]
\[
ightarrow j = = 240 = 360 
              rac{240}{36} pprox 6.67
\]

Again, j is not an integer.

Repeat the process to find some k, j pairs that produce integers:

- **For k = 2**:
\[
l = 5 + 7 \cdot 2 = 19
\]
\[
ightarrow j = = 170 = 360 
              rac{170}{57} pprox 2.98
\]

Continue trying values until finding an exact integer solution: 

- **For k = 5**:
\[
l = 5 + 7 \cdot 5 = 40
\]
\[
ightarrow j = -= -40 = 360 
               rac{1}{3}
\]

- **For k = 4**:
\[
l = 5 + 7 \cdot 4 = 33
\]
\[
ightarrow j = = 30  = 360 
              rac{30}{99} pprox 0.303
\]

- **For k = 3**:
\[
l = 5 + 7 \cdot 3 = 26
\]
\[
ightarrow j = = 100 = 360 
              rac{100}{78} pprox 1.282

\]

After computing various trials, **no solutions were found where both k and j are integers** for the given conditions in their respective arithmetic sequences. Since we find no precise matching pairs (k, j) that result in integer dimensions for the rectangle fitting the given area condition where both sides are expressed by their respective arithmetic sequences, we may conclude the problem has a constraint issue or more information is needed to locate an exact solution.

Thank you very much!

(agent) # REASONING

1. **Single Answer Requirement:** The question implicitly requires a single answer - the length of the shortest side of the rectangle. This is consistent with the requirement.

2. **Exact Answer Requirement:** The solution attempt reveals that the given question setups do not lead directly to an exact and unique pair `(k, j)` such that both sides `l` and `w` are integer values fitting the rectangle area condition `l * w = 360`. The computations in the solution do not yield a single, exact answer as they depend heavily on finding integer solutions that never materialize within the basic trials run.

3. **Dual Skill Requirement:** Though two skills are tested (area of a rectangle and identification of integers in an arithmetic sequence), the problem does not successfully integrate these skills to provide a complete and proper solution path that yields a result. The problem's statement allows for an infinite spectrum of integer combinations, which isn't practically solvable or testable in a straightforward manner without additional constraints or information.

4. **Clarity and Completeness:** The concepts and arithmetic sequences are clearly defined, however, the tying of these sequences to find a compatible \(k\) and \(j\) that satisfy both the area condition and integrality within the sequences fails. This lack of integrative clarity leads to potentially infinite attempts with no guaranteed solutions.

5. **Relevancy of Information:** All stated information is relevant, but the practical application leads to computational problems that do not successfully resolve using the provided data and constraints.

6. **Realism and Logic:** The problem setup is realistic in the sense that it works within the bounds of typical geometric and numerical properties. However, the logic falters when attempting to enforce the area condition strictly within the confines of the given arithmetic sequences, potentially necessitating a check on the realistic feasibility of such conditions coinciding.

7. **Syntax and Grammar:** The question and provided solution approach are syntactically and grammatically correct.

8. **Other Considerations:** Additional constraints or limiting parameters might be needed for the problem to ensure a solvable scenario within practical classroom settings. The infinite scope of trial and error in searching for integer solutions without a logical narrowing down process or algorithmic method reflects poorly on the question's pedagogical effectiveness in its current form.

# FINAL ANSWER
No

(user) The above analysis is correct. Solving the question involves manually checking for each value of k which is very laborius and grunt work, and computationally intractable given all the computations involved in the question are supposed to be done by hand. This is not ideal and might frustrate the students. Especially, if the solution is not achieved for smaller values of k, as seems to be the case from the solution provided, it would be computationally intractable for the students to arrive at an answer as it is not practical for students to substitute individual values of k and check for each value. This renders the question unfit for use.
