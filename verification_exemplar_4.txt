(user) You are a professional math teacher. You want to evaluate the analytical and mathematical reasoning abilities of your students. The evaluation is designed to test the students' expertise in using two given mathematical skills simultaneously. This is achieved by asking them to solve a question that necessitates expertise in both skills to be solved completely. Since evaluating the students is a critical task allowing very little margin for any error in the process, it is very important to ensure that the questions used for evaluating are high quality and fit for being used to evaluate the students. You need to carefully review the question and a given attempt at solving it, and ensure that the question is of high quality and fit to assess students. In order to do this, you should check the quality of the question with respect to several criteria, such as:

- Single Answer Requirement: The question should ask for one and only one final result. It should not request multiple distinct answers or pieces of information.
- Exact Answer Requirement: It should be possible to achieve one,exact answer to the question, without the need of making any approximations or assumptions whatsoever, unless explicitly specified in the question. There should be no margin for the students to arrive at any other possible answer due to things like rounding errors, etc.
- Dual Skill Requirement: The question must require rigorous expertise in both specified skills for resolution. Application of each skill and its subskills should be, necessary and contribute directly to obtaining the final answer; each skill should be applicable separately and critically during the problem-solving process. You are also given three example question - answer pairs for each skill in order to help you better understand the meaning of each skill. Please carefully review the question and its attempted solution, paying close attention to how well it aligns with the examples provided for each skill. Consider the depth and breadth of knowledge demonstrated in the examples. The complexity / difficulty of each skill application in the question should be similar or greater than the complexity / difficulty of the skill in the example question-answers given for that respective skill. 
- Clarity and Completeness: The question should be unambiguous and contain all the information necessary to complete the solution. Any required assumptions not common knowledge should be explicitly stated. Check for any ambiguity that might confuse students.
- Relevancy of Information: The question should not have any extra details that do not contribute to the solving of the problem.
- Realism and Logic: The question should involve realistic scenarios or hypotheses with logically consistent data. The specified operations and the contextual setup should reflect plausible mathematical situations. (e.g., positive amounts for transactions, integers for counts).
- Syntax and Grammar: The question must be grammatically correct and clearly written to prevent misinterpretation.
- etc. (any other problems which you think make the question not fit for being used for evaluating the students)

Your task is to give a 'Yes' or 'No' assessment, indicating whether the question is high quality and suitable for student evaluation. Provide thorough reasoning for your assessment based on the conditions mentioned above and any other relevant analytical points concerning mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. Your response should be structured as follows:

# REASONING
<Your detailed analysis justifying your decision>

# FINAL ANSWER
<'Yes' or 'No'. No other text should be present in this section>

Ensure to review the combination of skills intended for assessment, and check the logical flow and mathematical correctness from the question's setup to the solution's conclusion. Account for all the potential pitfalls such as logical inconsistencies, unnecessary complexity, or insufficient detail that may obstruct the clarity or solvability of the question.

Given below are the two skills and some example question-answer pairs for the two skills. This skill description is followed by the question which you need to check (preceded by '# QUESTION TO BE CHECKED') and its attempted solution (preceded by '# SOLUTION ATTEMPT'). 

SKILL 1: distance_and_midpoint_skills

Question 1: Rationalize the denominator of $\displaystyle \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{3} - \sqrt[3]{2}}$. With your answer in the form $\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt[3]{A} + \sqrt[3]{B} + \sqrt[3]{C}}{D}$, and the fraction in lowest terms, what is $A + B + C + D$? 
Answer 1: Since the denominator involves cube roots, we can't just multiply by a conjugate. Instead we use the identity $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Letting $a = \sqrt[3]{3}$ and $b = \sqrt[3]{2}$, we have \[
\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{3} - \sqrt[3]{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{3} - \sqrt[3]{2}} \cdot \frac{(\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \sqrt[3]{3} \sqrt[3]{2} + (\sqrt[3]{2})^2}{(\sqrt[3]{3})^2 + \sqrt[3]{3} \sqrt[3]{2} + (\sqrt[3]{2})^2}.
\]The denominator simplifies by the above identity to $(\sqrt[3]{3})^3 - (\sqrt[3]{2})^3 = 1$, so we are left with $\sqrt[3]{9} + \sqrt[3]{6} + \sqrt[3]{4}$. Matching the form given in the problem, $D = 1$ and $A = 9$, $B = 6$, $C = 4$ (in some order), so $A+B+C+D = \boxed{20}$.

Question 2: Dave rode 30 miles at 10 miles per hour and 10 miles at 30 miles per hour. What was his average speed, in miles per hour, for the entire ride?
Answer 2: Dave rode a total of $40$ miles.  The $30$ mile segment took $\frac{30}{10}=3$ hours, while the $10$ mile segment took $\frac{10}{30}=\frac{1}{3}$ hours, so the full ride took $3+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{10}{3}$ hours.

So the average speed was  $\frac{40}{\frac{10}{3}}=\boxed{12}$ miles per hour.

Question 3: What is the distance, in units, between the points $(3, -2)$ and $(7, 5)$?
Answer 3: We use the distance formula:  $$\sqrt{(7 - 3)^2 + (5 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{16 + 49} = \boxed{\sqrt{65}}.$$

SKILL 2: calculus_optimization_skills

Question 1: Find the positive root of
\[x^3 - 3x^2 - x - \sqrt{2} = 0.\] 
Answer 1: Since we have a coefficient of $\sqrt{2},$ we can guess that the positive root is of the form $a + b \sqrt{2},$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers.  So, let $x = a + b \sqrt{2}.$  Substituting, we get
\[(a + b \sqrt{2})^3 - 3(a + b \sqrt{2})^2 - (a + b \sqrt{2}) - \sqrt{2} = 0.\]This expands as
\[(a^3 + 3a^2 b \sqrt{2} + 6ab^2 + 2b^3 \sqrt{2}) - 3(a^2 + 2ab \sqrt{2} + 2b^2) - (a + b \sqrt{2}) - \sqrt{2} = 0,\]so
\[(a^3 + 6ab^2 - 3a^2 - 6b^2 - a) + (3a^2 b + 2b^3 - 6ab - b - 1) \sqrt{2} = 0.\]Hence,
\begin{align*}
a^3 + 6ab^2 - 3a^2 - 6b^2 - a &= 0, \\
3a^2 b + 2b^3 - 6ab - b - 1 &= 0.
\end{align*}From the first equation,
\[6ab^2 - 6b^2 = -a^3 + 3a^2 + a,\]so
\[6b^2 (a - 1) = -(a^3 - 3a^2 - a).\]Thus, $a - 1$ divides $a^3 - 3a^2 - a.$  Since $a - 1$ divides $(a - 1)(a - 3)(a + 1) = a^3 - 3a^2 - a + 3,$ $a - 1$ divides 3.  This means $a - 1$ can be $-3,$ $-1,$ 1, or 3, so $a$ is $-2$, 0, 2, or 4.

If $a = -2,$ then $b^2 = -1,$ which has no solutions.

If $a = 0,$ then $b^2 = 0,$ so $b = 0,$ which does not work.

If $a = 2,$ then $b^2 = 1,$ so $b = -1$ or $b = 1.$  Only $a = 2$ and $b = 1$ satisfy the second equation.

If $a = 4,$ then $b^2 = -\frac{2}{3},$ which has no solutions.

Therefore, $a = 2$ and $b = 1$ works, so $x = \boxed{2 + \sqrt{2}}.$

Question 2: Compute the product of the roots of the equation \[3x^3 - x^2 - 20x + 27 = 0.\] 
Answer 2: By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is the negation of the constant term divided by the leading ($x^3$) coefficient. Therefore, the answer is \[\frac{-27}{3} = \boxed{-9}.\](Don't forget to divide by the leading coefficient of the polynomial!)

Question 3: Compute
\[\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n}.\]
Answer 3: First, we decompose $\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n}$ into partial fractions.  We factor the denominator:
\begin{align*}
n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n &= n(n^5 - n^4 + n^3 - n^2 + n - 1) \\
&= n(n^4 (n - 1) + n^2 (n - 1) + (n - 1)) \\
&= n(n - 1)(n^4 + n^2 + 1) \\
&= n(n - 1)[(n^4 + 2n^2 + 1) - n^2] \\
&= n(n - 1)[(n^2 + 1)^2 - n^2] \\
&= n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1).
\end{align*}Then by partial fractions,
\[\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)} = \frac{A}{n} + \frac{B}{n - 1} + \frac{Cn + D}{n^2 + n + 1} + \frac{En + F}{n^2 - n + 1}\]for some constants $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F.$

Multiplying both sides by $n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1),$ we get
\begin{align*}
4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1 &= A(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + Bn(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).
\end{align*}Setting $n = 0,$ we get $-A = 1,$ so $A = -1.$

Setting $n = 1,$ we get $3B = 3,$ so $B = 1.$  The equation above then becomes
\begin{align*}
4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1 &= -(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + n(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\
&\quad + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).
\end{align*}This simplifies to
\[n^4 + 4n^3 - 2n^2 - n = (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).\]Dividing both sides by $n(n - 1),$ we get
\[-n^2 + 3n + 1 = (Cn + D)(n^2 - n + 1) + (En + F)(n^2 + n + 1).\]Expanding, we get
\[-n^2 + 3n + 1 = (C + E)n^3 + (C + D + E + F)n^2 + (C - D + E + F)n + D + F.\]Matching coefficients, we get
\begin{align*}
C + E &= 0, \\
-C + D + E + F &= -1, \\
C - D + E + F &= 3, \\
D + F &= 1.
\end{align*}Since $C + E = 0,$ $-D + F = 3.$  Hence, $D = -1$ and $F = 2.$  Then $-C + E = -2,$ so $C = 1$ and $E = -1.$  Therefore,
\[\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n} = \frac{1}{n - 1} - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{n - 1}{n^2 + n + 1} - \frac{n - 2}{n^2 - n + 1}.\]Then
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n} &= \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{7} \right) \\
&\quad + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{13} - \frac{1}{7} \right) \\
&\quad + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{21} - \frac{2}{13} \right) + \dotsb \\
&= \boxed{1}.
\end{align*}

# QUESTION TO BE CHECKED
Alice runs a small business delivering handmade cookies to local cafes. She is planning her route to minimize fuel costs and wants to determine the midpoint between two cafes to set up her distribution point. The coordinates of Cafe A are (1,3) and Cafe B are (7,7). After deciding the midpoint, she wants to check if placing her distribution point exactly at the midpoint would indeed minimize her total travel distance to both cafes as assumed. If the x-coordinate of the midpoint is `x_m` and y-coordinate is `y_m`, find the value of `x_m + y_m`.

# SOLUTION ATTEMPT
To solve this problem, we need to determine the midpoint between two points, Cafe A and Cafe B, whose coordinates are given, and then verify if the sum of distances from this midpoint to both cafes is minimized in relation to placing the distribution point elsewhere. Let's begin with finding the midpoint.

The midpoint, \( M \), of two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) in a plane can be calculated using the midpoint formula:
\[
x_m = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \quad y_m = \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}
\]

Substituting the coordinates for Cafe A (1, 3) and Cafe B (7, 7):
\[
x_m = \frac{1 + 7}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]
\[
y_m = \frac{3 + 7}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

Thus, the midpoint is \( (x_m, y_m) = (4, 5) \). The value of \( x_m + y_m \) is:
\[
x_m + y_m = 4 + 5 = 9
\]

Now, let's check whether placing the distribution point at this midpoint indeed minimizes the total distance to both cafes. This is typically true, and here’s why: The midpoint minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances from any point to each of the two points.

In Euclidean geometry, the total distance \( d \) along a straight line to two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) from a point \( (x, y) \) is generally minimized when \( (x, y) \) is at the midpoint, due to minimizing the sum of squared distances:
\[ (x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2 + (x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 \]
The function describing the sum of these distances is a quadratic function in \( x \) and \( y \), and it reaches its minimum value where \( (x, y) \) is the average of the points involved, which aligns with the coordinates of the midpoint calculated.

Since Alice's goal in selecting a location is presumably to minimize and balance travel distances proportionally to each cafe, placing her distribution point at this calculated midpoint (4, 5) indeed helps minimize fuel costs by reducing the total travel distance to both cafes, given that this distance under typical road conditions approximates straight-line (Euclidean) distance.

Hence, the solution to the question is that placing the distribution center at the midpoint will minimize travel distances to both cafes and \( x_m + y_m = 9 \).

Thank you very much!

(agent) # REASONING

Upon reviewing the question and its attempted solution based on the criteria for a high-quality question suitable for student evaluation, here are my conclusions:

1. **Single Answer Requirement**: The question effectively asks for a single final result—the value of \(x_m + y_m\). This meets the criterion of a single-answer requirement.

2. **Exact Answer Requirement**: The answer given, \(x_m + y_m = 9\), is derived through straightforward arithmetic following the midpoint formula. This is an exact answer, requiring no approximations.

3. **Dual Skill Requirement**: The problem requires knowledge of finding the midpoint between two points—a geometrical skill linked to the distance formula—and understanding the minimization of a sum of distances in a Euclidean plane (touching upon optimization principles in geometry). However, the optimization portion connected with calculus (demonstrated in example questions under Skill 2) is not fully applied here. The reasoning provided about why a midpoint minimizes the sum of distances is heuristic and based on a general geometric-optimal reasoning rather than an explicit calculus-based optimization process. Therefore, while the problem addresses geometrical concepts, the rigorous expertise in calculus optimally required is missing.

4. **Clarity and Completeness**: The question is clearly posed, with well-defined coordinates and objectives. No further assumptions are necessary outside common geometrical knowledge.

5. **Relevancy of Information**: All information provided is relevant and directly utilized in solving the problem.

6. **Realism and Logic**: The situation described is plausible and logically consistent, discussing a real-world application of minimizing travel distances which is a common logistical issue in operations or business scenarios.

7. **Syntax and Grammar**: The question is grammatically correct and clearly formulated to avoid confusion.

While the question serves well to gauge students' understanding of geometry (specifically the use of the distance and midpoint formulas), it does not adequately challenge their calculus skills, as per the intent described in the skill requirements. Therefore, the problem does not completely fit the requirements of assessing the two skills in question—geometry and calculus—simultaneously with depth.

# FINAL ANSWER
No

(user) The above analysis is partially correct. The agent correctly recognizes that the question above does not involve any application of "calculus_optimization_skills". However, the agent does not recognize that the question also asks for things which would not directly contribute to the final answer. The question says that "After deciding the midpoint, she wants to check if placing her distribution point exactly at the midpoint would indeed minimize her total travel distance to both cafes as assumed." which basically requires the students to verify their answer by calculating the distance of the obtained midpoint from the two points. While this does require the students to use mathematical reasoning abilities, this part would not make any different to the final answer, which is the midpoint. The students are evaluated solely on the basis on the final answer obtained by them. Thus asking the students to show a verification that the final answer is correct is not useful.
